# Parallel-Search-OpenMP
Searching for an element in a huge csv file can take quite a long time. Using parallel programming (with help of openmp library) we can divide the csv files in parts and search an eleemnt relatively quickly.
This project highlights how efficient parallel programming can be when compared to it's sequential counterparts.
